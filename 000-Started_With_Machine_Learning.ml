   #### Getting started with Machine Learning ###
    --------------------------------------------


    ## Types of machine learning problems ##

    1. On basis of the nature of the learning “signal” or “feedback”
        available to a learning system.

        *1-Supervised learning.
            *>Image Classification.
            *>Market Prediction/Regression.

        *2-Unsupervised learning.
            *>Clustering.
            *>High Dimension Visualization.
            *>Generative Models.

        *3-Semi-supervised learning.

        *4-Reinforcement learning.

    2. On the basis of “output” desired from a machine learned system.

        *1-Classification.
        *2-Regression.
        *3-Clustering.
        *4-Density estimation.
        *5-Dimensionality reduction.


    ## Terminologies of Machine Learning ##
      1-Model.
      2-Feature.
      3-Target (Label).
      4-Training.
      5-Prediction.
