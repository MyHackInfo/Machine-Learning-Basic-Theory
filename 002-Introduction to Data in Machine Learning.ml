### Introduction to Data in Machine Learning ###

  =>It can be any unprocessed fact, value, text, sound or picture
    that is not being interpreted and analyzed. Data is the most
    important part of all Data Analytics, Machine Learning,
    Artificial Intelligence. Without data, we can’t train any
    model and all modern research and automation will go vain.
    Big Enterprises are spending loads of money just to gather as
    much certain data as possible.

  =>Example: Why did Facebook acquire WhatsApp by paying a huge price
    of $19 billion?
    The answer is very simple and logical – it is to have access to
    the users’ information that Facebook may not have but WhatsApp will have.
    This information of their users is of paramount importance to Facebook as
    it will facilitate the task of improvement in their services.


### Machine Learning : What is it really? ###

  =>Well, Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence which
    evolved from Pattern Recognition and Computational Learning theory.
    Arthur Lee Samuel defines Machine Learning as: Field of study that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.


    Machine Learning: The Expected :==>
          1-Speech Recognition (Natural Language Processing in more technical terms)
          2-Computer Vision.
          3-Google’s Self Driving Car

    Machine Learning: The Unexpected :==>
          1-Amazon’s Product Recommendations.
          2-Youtube/Netflix.
          3-Data Mining / Big Data.
          4-Stock Market/Housing Finance/Real Estate.
